Recently I've completed a short course on Multilevel Water Governance with the international group of participants at the Hague Academy for Local Governance, Hague, The Netherlands. In training, we discussed international best practices and water governance tools, under the guidance of leading international experts and practitioners. I've got an interesting and fun learning experience.
I was from #OrangeKnowledge program also joined the worldwide social network of tap-water-drinkers. In the Hague Academy we also #jointhepipe and the dream of better plastic management and provision of clean drinking water for everyone around the world. Thank you Nuffic Global Development!, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The Netherlands, and The Hague Academy for Local Governance.
