I have introduced Kobo toolbox at [DASCOH Foundation](www.dascoh.org) on 12 January 2017 for the outcome survey. Then in all aspects in the sense of collecting data, I'm using Kobo toolbox. For example, in the baseline survey, MIS data, health-related data, a periodic survey conducted by Kobo toolbox.
I'm also supporting at [Kobotoolbox community forum](https://community.kobotoolbox.org/u/Suman/) by guiding the use of the tools and solving the raised issues.
