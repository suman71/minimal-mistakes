A team of Department of Geology and Mining, University of Rajshahi has made a visit on 31st March to 01st April, 2019 at a different location of Sapahar Upazila, Naogaon. Professor Sarwar Jahan Sajal and Professor Quamrul Hasan Mazumder led the team to achieve the objectives. 
On the way of Sapahar, the team took visit Managed Aquifer Recharge system at Nachole Union Parishad. Nachole UP building rooftop is being used for MAR. UP member Mr Ershad Ali and DASCOH’s Community Mobilizer Mr Belal shown the status of the MAR. The MAR system installed in 2017. The well depth is 160 ft. whereas the clay layer is 120 ft. This long depth of clay prevents the natural recharge. Pupils didn’t get sufficient water. That’s why the MAR was installed. The length of the roof is 135 ft. and the width is 25 ft. This 3375 square feet area store a significant amount of water that might loss if not recharge artificially.

‘Water is recharging without any interruption, but seems water is continuing declined its layer’ the UP member Ershad Ali said. Professor Sajal observed the Permanent Hydrograph Station’s (PHS) water level status. Professor Mazumder also monitored the water level measuring by Belal Ahmed. 
The water level record and hydrograph show the continuous declining of water level each year here. The rate of decreasing water level is higher than the recharge. 
‘A number of deep tubewells are in Nachole and constantly extracting groundwater. Buying a little amount of water with the high price makes low prices rice.’ WRMA Secretary Mr Abdus Sobhan also added.

After that, the team reached at Nischintopur, Sapahar and tried to make 1st survey near the Bazar. But after a multiple trials, it was not possible to take a reading. This is alarming that water is not there and exist in severe crisis. Local people also said that there was a deep tubewell with 190 ft depth. No tubewell is below 180 ft there. 
The 2nd station of the resistivity survey was Bilkrishno, Hapania Ghat, Goala, the flood plain of Punarbhaba River, near alluvion of it. The amazing characteristics have been observed during the survey. As the picture shows, the river was almost dry; have a little amount of water. In this floodplain, peoples getting water at only 18 ft. The field was green.

After successfully taking the survey, the team moved to the next station at Jobai Beel. But the norwester rain stopped the team to take the survey. The Beel was dried, no crops were being cultivated.

The next day, the team moved Shironti Union, near Dibar dighi which is a historical place. The same problem also arose there. The field is barren. No crops cultivating there other than wheat. The soil was so dry that didn’t give a reading. So the places kept for next visit after heavy rain when the soil will be wetted.

Finally, the team moved to visit Artificial Recharge at Rasulpur Canal. This artificial recharge system was made by BMDA on their excavated canal. The system is outstanding and effective for recharging a large amount of water. ‘With the proper filtering, this model should be replicated’ said prof. Sajal. He also said, a BMDA engineer who modified this recharge system is doing PhD. under his supervision, publishing an article on it. So it can be standard measurable ways to managed aquifer recharge.

The team moved to Rajshahi after two days of diligent activities. But everybody enjoyed a lot. The Sapahar is severe crisis zone in Barind than others. So, sustainable solutions are yet to be taken. Authorities should take proper steps to mitigate the problem.
