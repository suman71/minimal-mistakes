RAJSHAHI, March 22, 2017 (BSS)- Experts and others concerned at a post-rally discussion here today unequivocally called for creating public awareness for protecting the existing water resources from further pollution and contamination to safeguard human civilization and biodiversity.

They viewed the water resources in the region including its vast Barind tract need to be protected and conserved and need-oriented water rules and policies have become indispensable to this end.

District administration and local office of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) jointly organized the meeting at conference hall of deputy commissioner in observance of the World Water Day- 2017.

Deputy Commissioner Kazi Ashraf Uddin and Superintendent of Police Moazzem Hossain Bhuiyan addressed the discussion as chief and special guests respectively with Mukhlesur Rahman, Executive Engineer of BWDB, in the chair.

Executive Engineer of Department of Public Health Engineering Khan Golam Rabbani, Executive Engineer of Local Government Engineering Department Golam Mostofa, Secretary of Rajshahi WASA Sadequl Islam and Assistant Project Coordinator of Integrated Water Resource Management Project of DASCOH Foundation Jahangir Alam Khan also spoke.

During his keynote presentation, Halim Salehi, Sub-divisional Engineer of BWDB, says the issue of vulnerabilities caused by abnormal declining of both underground and surface water resources in the dried area has become a grave concern. So, there is no alternative to formulate a time-fitting policy.

He said the climate change has been acknowledged as the depletion of
natural resources and as a major threat to humanity and urged the policy planners and others concerned to take immediate effective measures to address the adverse impact.

Substantial and sustainable promotion of water and sanitation related modern technologies have become the demand of time. The Padma River needs a capital dredging.

"If the width of the river is reduced and depth increased, the river will be useful for surface water irrigation as well as resist increase of salinity in the region," he said.

Engineer Salehi puts emphasis on groundwater recharging by enriching the surface water resources through necessary excavation and re-excavation of the derelict ponds and canals and treatment of the water on an emergency basis.
